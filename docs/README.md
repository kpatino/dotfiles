# README

Information contained here are notes regarding my current sway config and explanations as to why things are setup the way they are in case I forget. It may also be useful to others trying to get something to work.  

My setup also tends to use systemd provides utilities and programs such as systemd-networkd and systemd-boot because I don't want to install more packages for needs that are already provided.
